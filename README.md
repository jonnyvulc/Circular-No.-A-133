Subpart B--Audits
§___.200    Audit requirements.
(a) Audit required. Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part. Guidance on determining Federal awards expended is provided in §___.205.
(b) Single audit. Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single audit conducted in accordance with §___.500 except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Program-specific audit election. When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&D) and the Federal program's laws, regulations, or grant agreements do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program- specific audit conducted in accordance with §___.235. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.
(d) Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003). Non-Federal
8
 
entities that expend less than $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in §___.215(a), but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and General Accounting Office (GAO).
(e) Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
§___.205 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
(a) Determining Federal awards expended. The determination of when an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non- Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.
(b) Loan and loan guarantees (loans). Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:
(1) Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year;
 plus
Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus
received.
(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance
(2) Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal
(c) Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education. When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
(d) Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans). Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.
(e) Endowment funds. The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted.
(f) Free rent. Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part
9

of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.
(g) Valuing non-cash assistance. Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.
(h) Medicare. Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.
(i) Medicaid. Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost- reimbursement basis.
(j) Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration. For purposes of this part, loans made from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility that are funded by contributions from insured institutions are not considered Federal awards expended.
§___.210 Subrecipient and vendor determinations.
(a) General. An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a vendor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a vendor would not be considered Federal awards. The guidance in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services.
       (b)
received by
assistance;
Federal award. Characteristics indicative of a Federal award a subrecipient are when the organization:
(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal financial
(2) Has its performance measured against whether the objectives of the Federal program are met;
(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making;
(4) Has responsibility for adherence to applicable Federal
program compliance requirements; and
(5) Uses the Federal funds to carry out a program of the organization as compared to providing goods or services for a program of the pass-through entity.
(c) Payment for goods and services. Characteristics indicative of a payment for goods and services received by a vendor are when the organization:
operations;
(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business
10

purchasers;
(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different
(3)   Operates in a competitive environment;
(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and
program.
(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal
(d) Use of judgment in making determination. There may be unusual circumstances or exceptions to the listed characteristics. In making the determination of whether a subrecipient or vendor relationship exists, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. It is not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and judgment should be used in determining whether an entity is a subrecipient or vendor.
(e) For-profit subrecipient. Since this part does not apply to for- profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The contract with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for- profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the contract, and post-award audits.
(f) Compliance responsibility for vendors. In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor transactions which are structured such that the vendor is responsible for program compliance or the vendor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
§___.215 Relation to other audit requirements.
(a) Audit under this part in lieu of other audits. An audit made in accordance with this part shall be in lieu of any financial audit required under individual Federal awards. To the extent this audit meets a Federal agency's needs, it shall rely upon and use such audits. The provisions of this part neither limit the authority of Federal agencies, including their Inspectors General, or GAO to conduct or arrange for additional audits (e.g., financial audits, performance audits, evaluations, inspections, or reviews) nor authorize any auditee to constrain Federal agencies from carrying out additional audits. Any additional audits shall be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed by other auditors.
(b) Federal agency to pay for additional audits. A Federal agency that conducts or contracts for additional audits shall, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.
11
 
(c) Request for a program to be audited as a major program. A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in §___.520 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.
§___.220    Frequency of audits.
Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part shall be performed annually. Any biennial audit shall cover both years within the biennial period.
(a) A State or local government that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period under audit.
(b) Any non-profit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.
§___.225    Sanctions.
No audit costs may be charged to Federal awards when audits required by
 this part
part. In
conducted
entities shall take appropriate action using sanctions such as:
have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with this cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit
in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through
(a) Withholding a percentage of Federal awards until the audit is completed satisfactorily;
(b) Withholding or disallowing overhead costs;
(c) Suspending Federal awards until the audit is conducted; or
      (d) Terminating the Federal award.
§___.230    Audit costs.
(a) Allowable costs. Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations.
12

(b) Unallowable costs. A non-Federal entity shall not charge the following to a Federal award:
(1) The cost of any audit under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) not conducted in accordance with this part.
(2) The cost of auditing a non-Federal entity which has Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) per year and is thereby exempted under §___.200(d) from having an audit conducted under this part. However, this does not prohibit a pass-through entity from charging Federal awards for the cost of limited scope audits to monitor its subrecipients in accordance with §___.400(d)(3), provided the subrecipient does not have a single audit. For purposes of this part, limited scope audits only include agreed-upon procedures engagements conducted in accordance with either the AICPA’s generally accepted auditing standards or attestation standards, that are paid for and arranged by a pass- through entity and address only one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; matching, level of effort, earmarking; and, reporting.
§___.235    Program-specific audits.
(a) Program-specific audit guide available. In many cases, a program- specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such a guide is available. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor shall follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.
(b) Program-specific audit guide not available. (1) When a program- specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.
(2) The auditee shall prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of §___.315(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of §___.315(c).
            (3)   The auditor shall:

13
 
(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of §___.500(e).
(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

(1) The audit shall be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor’s report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the Federal agency that provided the funding or a different period is specified in a program- specific audit guide. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, the audit shall be completed and the required reporting shall be submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor’s report(s), or 13 months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.) Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make report copies available for public inspection.
(2) When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee shall submit to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB the data collection form prepared in accordance with §___.320(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide to be retained as an archival copy.

14
 
§___.320(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and one copy of this reporting package shall be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB to be retained as an archival copy. Also, when the schedule of findings and questioned costs disclosed audit findings or the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any audit findings, the auditee shall submit one copy of the reporting package to the Federal clearinghouse on behalf of the Federal awarding agency, or directly to the pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient. Instead of submitting the reporting package to the pass-through entity, when a subrecipient is not required to submit a reporting package to the pass-through entity, the subrecipient shall provide written notification to the pass-through entity, consistent with the requirements of §___.320(e)(2). A subrecipient may submit a copy of the reporting package to the pass-through entity to comply with this notification requirement.
(d) Other sections of this part may apply. Program-specific audits are subject to §___.100 through §___.215(b), §___.220 through §___.230, §___.300 through §___.305, §___.315, §___.320(f) through §___.320(j), §___.400

Auditor selection.
15

(a) Auditor procurement. In procuring audit services, auditees shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Grants Management Common Rule (hereinafter referred to as the "A-102 Common Rule") published March 11, 1988 and amended April 19, 1995 [insert appropriate CFR citation], Circular A-110, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations," or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable (OMB Circulars are available from the Office of Administration, Publications Office, room 2200, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503). Whenever possible, auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority- owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in the A-102 Common Rule, OMB Circular A-110, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of external quality control reviews, and price.
(b) Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals. An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.
(c) Use of Federal auditors. Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.
§___.310    Financial statements.
(a) Financial statements. The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this part. However, organization-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with §___.500(a) and prepare separate financial statements.
(b) Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards. The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of Federal awards expended for each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:
            (1)   List individual Federal programs by Federal agency.  For
Federal programs included in a cluster of programs, list individual Federal
programs within a cluster of programs.  For R&D, total Federal awards expended
shall be shown either by individual award or by Federal agency and major
subdivision within the Federal agency.  For example, the National Institutes
of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human
Services.
16
 
            (2)   For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of
the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through
entity shall be included.
            (3)   Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual
Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA
information is not available.
            (4)   Include notes that describe the significant accounting
policies used in preparing the schedule.
            (5)   To the extent practical, pass-through entities should
identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each
Federal program.
            (6)   Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule,
the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance,
the amount of insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan
guarantees outstanding at year end.  While not required, it is preferable to
present this information in the schedule.
§___.315    Audit findings follow-up.
(a) General. The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee shall prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee shall also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under §___.510(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it shall include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred.
(b) Summary schedule of prior audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings shall report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs relative to Federal awards. The summary schedule shall also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
            (1)   When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary
schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action
was taken.
            (2)   When audit findings were not corrected or were only
partially corrected, the summary schedule shall describe the planned
corrective action as well as any partial corrective action taken.
            (3)   When corrective action taken is significantly different from
corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the
Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary
schedule shall provide an explanation.
            (4)   When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer
valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position shall be
described in the summary schedule.  A valid reason for considering an audit
finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have
occurred:
(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which 17
 
the finding occurred was submitted to the Federal clearinghouse;
                  (ii)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not
currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
                  (iii) A management decision was not issued.
(c) Corrective action plan. At the completion of the audit, the auditee shall prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan shall provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan shall include an explanation and specific reasons.
§___.320    Report submission.

Subpart D--Federal Agencies and Pass-Through Entities
§___.400    Responsibilities.
(a) Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities. Recipients expending more than $25 million ($50 million for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) a year in Federal awards shall have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated cognizant agency for audit shall be the Federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient unless OMB makes a specific cognizant agency for audit assignment.
Following is effective for fiscal years ending on or before December 31, 2003:
To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant
amount of direct funding shall be based upon direct Federal awards expended in
the recipient's fiscal years ending in 1995, 2000, 2005, and every fifth year
thereafter.  For example, audit cognizance for periods ending in 1997 through
2000 will be determined based on Federal awards expended in 1995.  (However,
for States and local governments that expend more than $25 million a year in
Federal awards and have previously assigned cognizant agencies for audit, the
requirements of this paragraph are not effective until fiscal years beginning
after June 30, 2000.)
Following is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003:
The determination of the predominant amount of direct funding shall be based
upon direct Federal awards expended in the recipient's fiscal years ending in
2004, 2009, 2014, and every fifth year thereafter.  For example, audit
cognizance for periods ending in 2006 through 2010 will be determined based on
Federal awards expended in 2004.  (However, for 2001 through 2005,the
cognizant agency for audit is determined based on the predominant amount of
direct Federal awards expended in the recipient's fiscal year ending in 2000).
Notwithstanding the manner in which audit cognizance is determined, a Federal
awarding agency with cognizance for an auditee may reassign cognizance to
another Federal awarding agency which provides substantial direct funding and
agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit.  Within 30 days after any
reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit shall notify
the auditee, and, if known, the auditor of the reassignment.  The cognizant
agency for audit shall:
 auditors.
(1) Provide technical audit advice and liaison to auditees and
(2) Consider auditee requests for extensions to the report
21

submission due date required by §___.320(a). The cognizant agency for audit may grant extensions for good cause.
(3) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews of selected audits made by non-Federal auditors, and provide the results, when appropriate, to other interested organizations.
(4) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate Federal law enforcement officials of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor of irregularities or illegal acts, as required by GAGAS or laws and regulations.
(5) Advise the auditor and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee shall work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit shall notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors shall be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.
(6) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon audits performed in accordance with this part.
(7) Coordinate a management decision for audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency.
(8) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.
(9) For biennial audits permitted under §___.220, consider auditee requests to qualify as a low-risk auditee under §___.530(a).
(b) Oversight agency for audit responsibilities. An auditee which does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with §___.105. The oversight agency for audit:
(1) Shall provide technical advice to auditees and auditors as
requested.
(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.
(c) Federal awarding agency responsibilities. The Federal awarding agency shall perform the following for the Federal awards it makes:
(1) Identify Federal awards made by informing each recipient of the CFDA title and number, award name and number, award year, and if the award is for R&D. When some of this information is not available, the Federal agency shall provide information necessary to clearly describe the Federal award.
(2) Advise recipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
(3) Ensure that audits are completed and reports are received 22
 
in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(4) Provide technical advice and counsel to auditees and auditors as requested.
(5) Issue a management decision on audit findings within six months after receipt of the audit report and ensure that the recipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action.
(6) Assign a person responsible for providing annual updates of the compliance supplement to OMB.
(d) Pass-through entity responsibilities. A pass-through entity shall perform the following for the Federal awards it makes:
(1) Identify Federal awards made by informing each subrecipient of CFDA title and number, award name and number, award year, if the award is R&D, and name of Federal agency. When some of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
(2) Advise subrecipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity.
(3) Monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to ensure that Federal awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and that performance goals are achieved.
(4) Ensure that subrecipients expending $300,000 ($500,000 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003) or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year have met the audit requirements of this part for that fiscal year.
(5) Issue a management decision on audit findings within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action.
(6) Consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records.
(7) Require each subrecipient to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part.
§___.405    Management decision.
(a) General. The management decision shall clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request
additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.
(b) Federal agency. As provided in §___.400(a)(7), the cognizant agency for audit shall be responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency.
23
 
As provided in §___.400(c)(5), a Federal awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to recipients. Alternate arrangements may be made on a case-by-case basis by agreement among the Federal agencies concerned.
(c) Pass-through entity. As provided in §___.400(d)(5), the pass- through entity shall be responsible for making the management decision for audit findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.
(d) Time requirements. The entity responsible for making the management decision shall do so within six months of receipt of the audit report. Corrective action should be initiated within six months after receipt of the audit report and proceed as rapidly as possible.
(e) Reference numbers. Management decisions shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with §___.510(c).
Subpart E--Auditors
§___.500    Scope of audit.
(a) General. The audit shall be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit shall cover the entire operations of the auditee; or, at the option of the auditee, such audit shall include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units which expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such fiscal year, provided that each such audit shall encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which shall be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards shall be for the same fiscal year.
(b) Financial statements. The auditor shall determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor shall also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements taken as a whole.
(c) Internal control. (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for major programs.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the auditor shall:
(i) Plan the testing of internal control over major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions
relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and
(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor shall report a reportable condition (including whether any such condition is a material weakness) in accordance with §___.510, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective
24
 
internal control.
(d) Compliance. (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.
(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.
(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor shall determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should use the types of compliance requirements contained in the compliance supplement as guidance for identifying the types of compliance requirements to test, and determine the requirements governing the Federal program by reviewing the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the laws and regulations referred to in such contracts and grant agreements.
(4) The compliance testing shall include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
(e) Audit follow-up. The auditor shall follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with §___.315(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor shall perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program in the current year.
(f) Data Collection Form. As required in §___.320(b)(3), the auditor shall complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.
§___.505    Audit reporting.
      The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or
separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in
this section.  The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was
conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
(b) A report on internal control related to the financial statements and major programs. This report shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c) A report on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a
25
 
material effect on the financial statements. This report shall also include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which shall include the following three components:
(1) A summary of the auditor's results which shall include:
(i) The type of report the auditor issued on the financial statements of the auditee (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified
opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
(ii) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial
statements and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
(iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance which is material to the financial statements of the auditee;
(iv) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
(v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse
opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any
audit findings which the auditor is required to report under §___.510(a); (vii) An identification of major programs;
(viii)The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in §___.520(b); and
(ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under §___.530.
(2) Findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
(3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which shall include audit findings as defined in §___.510(a).
(i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) which relate to the same
issue should be presented as a single audit finding.  Where practical, audit
findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(ii) Audit findings which relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.
§___.510    Audit findings.
26

(a) Audit findings reported. The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:
(1) Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.
(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement.
(3) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
(4) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding.
(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.
(6) Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with §___.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
(b) Audit finding detail. Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be
27
 
included, as applicable, in audit findings:
(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.
(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(4) Identification of questioned costs and how they were
computed.
(5) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.
(6) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.
(7) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(8) Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.
(c) Reference numbers. Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.
§___.515    Audit working papers.
(a) Retention of working papers. The auditor shall retain working papers and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor shall contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the working papers and reports.
(b) Access to working papers. Audit working papers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, a Federal agency providing direct or indirect funding, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to working papers includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of working papers, as is reasonable and necessary.
28
 
§___.520    Major program determination.
(a) General. The auditor shall use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach shall include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section shall be followed.
(b) Step 1. (1) The auditor shall identify the larger Federal programs, which shall be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the larger of:
(i) $300,000 or three percent (.03) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards
expended equal or exceed $300,000 but are less than or equal to $100 million.
(ii) $3 million or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total
Federal awards expended exceed $100 million but are less than or equal to $10
billion.
(iii) $30 million or 15 hundredths of one percent (.0015) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total
Federal awards expended exceed $10 billion.
(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be labeled Type B programs.
(3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) should not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans significantly affects the number or size of Type A programs, the auditor shall consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs.
(4) For biennial audits permitted under §___.220, the determination of Type A and Type B programs shall be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.
(c) Step 2. (1) The auditor shall identify Type A programs which are low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it shall have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, it shall have had no audit findings under §___.510(a). However, the auditor may use judgment and consider that audit findings from questioned costs under §___.510(a)(3) and §___.510(a)(4), fraud under §___.510(a)(6), and audit follow-up for the summary schedule of prior audit findings under §___.510(a)(7) do not preclude the Type A program from being low-risk. The auditor shall consider: the criteria in §___.525(c), §___.525(d)(1), §___.525(d)(2), and §___.525(d)(3); the results of audit follow-up; whether any changes in personnel or systems affecting a Type A program have significantly increased risk; and apply professional judgment in determining whether a Type A program is low-risk.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program at certain recipients may not be considered low-risk. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as major each year at particular recipients to allow the Federal agency to comply with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (31 U.S.C. 3515). The Federal agency shall notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor at least 180 days prior to the
29
 
end of the fiscal year to be audited of OMB's approval.
(d) Step 3. (1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in §___.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in §___.525(b)(1), §___.525(b)(2), and §___.525(c)(1), a single criteria in §___.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.
(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:
(i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100
million in total Federal awards expended.
(ii) $300,000 or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million
in total Federal awards expended.
(e) Step 4. At a minimum, the auditor shall audit all of the following as major programs:
(1) All Type A programs, except the auditor may exclude any Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(2) (i) High-risk Type B programs as identified under either of the following two options:
(A) Option 1. At least one half of the Type B programs identified as high-risk under Step 3 (paragraph (d) of this section),
except this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) does not require the auditor to audit more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2.
                          (B)  Option 2.  One high-risk Type B program for
each Type A program identified as low-risk under Step 2.
(ii) When identifying which high-risk Type B programs to audit as major under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) or (B),
the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for
different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of
time.
(3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This paragraph (e)(3) may require the auditor to audit more programs as major than the number of Type A programs.
(f) Percentage of coverage rule. The auditor shall audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total Federal awards expended. If the auditee meets the criteria in §___.530 for a low-risk auditee, the auditor need only audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 25 percent of total Federal awards expended.
(g) Documentation of risk. The auditor shall document in the working 30
 
papers the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.
(h) Auditor's judgment. When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs shall be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall only be for clearly improper use of the guidance in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor shall consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.
(i) Deviation from use of risk criteria. For first-year audits, the auditor may elect to determine major programs as all Type A programs plus any Type B programs as necessary to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Under this option, the auditor would not be required to perform the procedures discussed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
(1) A first-year audit is the first year the entity is audited under this part or the first year of a change of auditors.
(2) To ensure that a frequent change of auditors would not preclude audit of high-risk Type B programs, this election for first-year audits may not be used by an auditee more than once in every three years.
§___.525    Criteria for Federal program risk.
(a) General. The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring which could be material to the Federal program. The auditor shall use auditor judgment and consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(b) Current and prior audit experience. (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.
(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a
large single audit, the auditor shall consider whether weaknesses are isolated
in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout
the entity.
(ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients
would indicate higher risk.
(iii) The extent to which computer processing is used to administer Federal programs, as well as the complexity of that processing,
should be considered by the auditor in assessing risk.  New and recently
modified computer systems may also indicate risk.
(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.
(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs 31
 
may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs
without audit findings.
(c) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities. (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplement.
(d) Inherent risk of the Federal program. (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have a high-risk for time and effort reporting, but otherwise be at low-risk.
(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, laws, regulations, or the provisions of contracts or grant agreements may increase risk.
(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.
§___.530    Criteria for a low-risk auditee.
An auditee which meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two years (or, in the case of biennial audits, preceding two audit periods) shall qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with §___.520:
(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this part. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee, unless agreed to in advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit.
(b) The auditor's opinions on the financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unqualified. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that an opinion qualification does not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that any identified material weaknesses do not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
32
 
(d) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two years (or, in the case of biennial audits, preceding two audit periods) in which they were classified as Type A programs:
(1) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses;
(2) Noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements which have a material effect on the Type A program; or
(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the year.
